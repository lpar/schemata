# Schemata

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/lpar/schemata?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/lpar/schemata)

Helper methods for creating test schemas in databases, with copies of tables from the live schema. Thread-safe, so you can call them from unit tests.

Built for PostgreSQL but may work with other databases that use compatible SQL syntax.

Needs unit tests (hint hint) but is very short, under a hundred lines.
